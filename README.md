## App State Inspector

This is a prototype app I wrote for debugging and visualising app state in mithril.js apps. The intent was to improve on `console.log` style debugging, especially on pages with rapid state changes (e.g. frequent mouse events or input events).

It has been somewhat useful for me, but not as much as I originally thought. There are also some known issues/bugs.

I may come back and revamp this project at some point, but right now it isn't a high priority.
